# time_wrapper - Execute or don't execute commands based on current time

### Motivation

One way to not be woken up at night is to downgrade your checks
from critical to warning, another way is to only alert during office
hours. This doesn't always make sense, but for example if you prefer
to run a cronjob during the night, but if it fails you only want to be
alerted in the morning - either configure your monitoring, or wrap the
check with this tool.

### Usage

  * Example 1
    * `time_wrapper --days 1,2,3,4,5 --from 8 --to 18 -- date`
    * Execute `date`, but only Mon-Fri from 08:00:00 to 17:59:59 UTC
  * Example 2
    * `time_wrapper --days 0,6 --from 20 --to 24 -- date +%s`
    * Execute `date +%s`, but only Sat+Sun from 20:00:00 to 23:59:59 UTC
  * Help
    * `time_wrapper -h`
